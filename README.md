Fyber R-Project
===============

This is a project created as a challenge for Fyber. 
It consists of a web page that manage the most currently information about
each [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) package, so you can find quickly the info and download the
package.


This challenge was made using Ruby 2.0.0 with [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and
[Rspec](http://rspec.info/). 

You can chek this project online [here](http://r-packages.herokuapp.com/packages). 

For now it saves 600 packages but the idea is work with all the
packages.
